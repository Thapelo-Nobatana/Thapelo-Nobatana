## ` Software Engineer (Developer / Creator) ` ##

I’m a frontend software engineer, With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and CSS pre-processors and  design tools such as Figma, I build responsive, high-performance interfaces that elevate the user experience. My expertise extends to optimizing web performance, ensuring cross-browser compatibility, and implementing seamless integrations with back-end services.ALL coding projects are built from the ground up. I thrive on collaboration, working closely with designers and back-end engineers to turn ideas into reality. Whether it's improving an existing application or starting a new project from scratch, I am driven by solving complex challenges and delivering clean, maintainable code. Always eager to learn and grow, I stay up-to-date with the latest web development trends and best practices.
In my free time, I love experimenting with new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and exploring design principles to enhance the overall aesthetic of the web.
